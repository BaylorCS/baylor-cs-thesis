\chapter{This is a Very Long Header Title Which Will Span Multiple Lines on the Page and the Contents}

\section{Regular Paragraphs}
You will start with a section. 
There is supposed to be a Triple Space between the section text and the preceeding text. 
In this particular case, the preceeding text is the chapter's title. 
This is filler text so I an fill up the line. Blah Blah. 

\section{More Paragraphs}
This is another section. 
There is likewise triple space between the preceeding text and this section's title. 
The observant will notice that there is a double space between the section's title and this text. 

\subsection{Additional Paragraphs}
This is a subsection. 
Just like the section, there is a triple space between the preceeding text and the subsection's title. 
And just like the section, there is a double space between the subsection's title and the subsection's text. 

\subsection{More Subsections}
Same concept. Triple Space before title and double space after. 
Just To show a demonstration, some garbage text will follow this in a new paragraph. 

\lipsum[1]

\subsubsection{Subsubsections}
Subsubsections can be used. Maps to Level 5 on the graduate school requirements. 
And just like section and subsection, there is a triple space before the title. 
But then everything changes. 
There is a period after the title followed by 2 spaces. 
But fear not, this behavior is defined in the template. 

\subsubsection{Capitalization is not the same}
The grad school asked to use sentence cases instead of header cases in the title of the subsubsection. 
Alvin believes this will change eventually. 

\section{Stacked Headings}

\stack

\subsection{This is a Stacked Heading}
In other words there is no text in the section, and we immidiately introduce a subsection. 
To get spacing right when sections are adjacent to subsections (when headings are stacked), 
we once needed to use the \texttt{$\backslash$stack} command in between.
But this is now handled correctly byt the teplate (.cls) file. So do not use the stack command. 
It is marked obsolete in the template. 

In other words: there has to always be a triple space between the text preceeding the subsection title and the subsection title. 
In this particular case the text preceeding the subsection title is the section title. 
But the same rule applies: triple space. 
Assuming this changes, adjust accordingly in the template. 

\subsection{Deeper Stacks}

\stack % DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND

\subsubsection{This is a Stacked Deep Heading}
Same as before, there is no text between the subsection above and the subsubsection here. 
But fear not. 'Tis taken care of by the template. 
Unless the requirements change, in which case I'm adjusting the 1em vspace in the template should be fine.

\subsubsection{But This is Not}
But it's fine. It's just another Level 5. Or if you prefer -- a subsubsection. Whichever you choose to call it.
