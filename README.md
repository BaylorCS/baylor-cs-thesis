Template for creating a Master's Thesis with LaTeX for Baylor's computer science program.

##### FAQ

* I'm doing project, not thesis; how do I change the autogenerated title? 
  * Edit thesis.cls at line 327: A Thesis -> A Project
* I want to shorten authors to 'Author et al.' when there are more than two, how? 
  * This templates uses package [chicago], which does that by _\shortcite_. More info at http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/chicago/chicago.sty
* My links to chapters and sections are not clickable, why? 
  * This issue was solved by adding \usepackage{hyperref}. However, that caused problems with appendicies. Adding \appendix before actually including them seem to solve the issue.
