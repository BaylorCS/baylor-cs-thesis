baylor-cs-thesis
================

Template for creating a Master's Thesis with LaTeX for Baylor's computer science program.

FAQ:

* I'm doing project, not thesis; how do I change the autogenerated title? 
  * Edit thesis.cls at line 327: A Thesis -> A Project
- I want to shorten authors to 'Author et al.' when there are more than two, how? 
  * This templates uses package [chicago], which does that by _\shortcite_. More info at http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/chicago/chicago.sty
